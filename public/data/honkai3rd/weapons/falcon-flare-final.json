After passing through Silverwing: N-EX's scatter barrier, energy ball becomes powered-up and deals 400% Ice DMG on impact and triggers a small Black Hole, continuously drawing in nearby enemies to deal 30 x 10.0% Ice DMG followed by an explosion dealing 500.0% Ice DMG. Powered-up energy balls reduce Weapon Skill CD by 3.0s upon impact.
