# Murata Himeko

Blazing Legacy Set

## Rebellious Fire 2 세트

In Herrscher form, a stack granted by the B-pc of this set provides another 15.0% bonus Fire DMG. The host takes 45.0% less Indirect DMG at below 60% HP.

## Everlasting Flames 3 세트

Boosts Total DMG by 20.0%. When the host loses HP, her next attack will deal 100% ATK of Fire DMG to surrounding enemies, which on hit boosts her Total DMG by 10.0% for 10s (CD: 2s; triggering it again resets the duration).
