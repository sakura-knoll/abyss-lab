The explosion deals 100.0% ATK of Physical DMG to nearby enemies and generates a crystalline force field that persists for 5s, reducing the Move Speed of enemies within it by 70%. Hitting a weakspot deals 750.0% DMG to the target, makes the explosion deal 50% ATK of bonus Physical DMG, and immobilizes enemies in the blast radius for 1s. Miss Pink Elf♪ equip bonus: If the target is carrying a Crystalline Seed, the explosion will spread seeds to surrounding enemies.
