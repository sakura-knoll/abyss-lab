            <speak chara="_bertrandY">Ah, youngsters, you don’t need to get sentimental over an old man like me.</speak>

            <speak chara="_bertrandY">When the Emperor was still the emperor, as long as he was working, you would not find the emotion called “sadness” in him.</speak>
            <speak chara="_bertrandY">He said that the greatest kind of people in this world are the “Positively acting pessimists”.</speak>
            <speak chara="_bertrandY">He was the greatest of all pessimists: He knows that mankind will continue to struggle to survive, and that there is no benevolent power helping us in secret.</speak>
            <speak chara="_bertrandY">But even then he doesn’t act negatively or scared: Even if he knows he is weak, he continues to move forward towards his goal.</speak>
            <speak chara="_bertrandY">Because he knows deep down: In this world, only actions mean anything, and only actions can change destiny.</speak>

            <speak chara="_Rita">“It’s easier said than done”, I remember there was such a saying in the East.</speak>

            <speak chara="_bertrandY">The former can only sit back and complain; The latter gets stubborn and fans the flames.</speak>
            <speak chara="_bertrandY">The Emperor said that this kind of balance is difficult to grasp - He himself only performed well when compiling the “Civil Code”.</speak>
            <speak chara="_bertrandY">He said that the “Civil Code” was the perfect combination of thought and action, and would never be abandoned by history.</speak>

            <speak chara="_bertrandY">Hahahaha, you’re right. Your career is the cornerstone of everything. As long as you don’t betray it, you deserve the praise of most people.</speak>
            <speak chara="_bertrandY">As you know, the Emperor sacrificed the entirety of Europe for his own interests, and for the interests of France… That eventually became a fatal stain on him.</speak>
            <speak chara="_bertrandY">Beethoven even ripped off the title of the symphony composed for him and changed “Bonaparte” to “A hero”.</speak>
            <speak chara="_bertrandY">After all… compared to the whole world, an Emperor and tens of millions of French people are just a small few.</speak>

            <speak chara="_bertrandY">That’s a good way to think.</speak>
            <speak chara="_bertrandY">Judging from what you reported, the emperor may have chosen to integrate with his subjects into a new form of life just to avoid that.</speak>
            <speak chara="_bertrandY">But for what price? These subjects were his most loyal and radical servants in the past. Combining with them only allowed a group of people to rush down the road of paranoia even more quickly.</speak>
            <speak chara="_bertrandY">Perhaps, picking up the fragments of mankind and fusing them all together is a way to transcend Honkai--</speak>
            <speak chara="_bertrandY">--But this example before us is definitely the worst of the worst. It’s a child born from personal and deformed desires.</speak>
