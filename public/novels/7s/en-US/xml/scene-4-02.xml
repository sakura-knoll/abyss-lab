    <p>Empyrea Phoenix, Ebonstyle, Issen Manor.[\s]</p>
    <p>In Shenzhou’s martial world, these are all famed and respectable names.</p>
  </text>
  <text>But here in the endless desert, these are merely meaningless words.</text>
  <text>
    <p>The desert is an honorless, lawless wilderness:[\s]</p>
    <p>「The strong live, the weak die.」</p>
  </text>
  <motion chara="002" action="img_trans" img="素裳-绝望张嘴-持剑-远景"></motion>
  <text>
    <p>「Perhaps this is why,」 Sushang thought.</p>
    <p>「This was why Mother sent me to train here despite Father’s protests.」</p>

  <text>Sushang began training when she was only a year old toddler;</text>
  <text>
    <p>Her mother dotes on her a lot,</p>
    <p>but she was also extremely strict when it came to her sword training.</p>
  </text>
  <text>Sushang endured many hardships, she’d be awoken from the pain from her training at night.</text>
  <text inline="true">She would cry to her father about this- but that would only make her mother even harsher. </text>
  <text>Not even the master of 「Issen Manor」, 「Young Marquis Of Sichuan」 Li Shen, could withstand a glance from her mother.</text>
  <text>
    <p>Since then, Sushang doubled her efforts in practicing swordsmanship and her family’s twelve ways of 「Issin Mnemonics」 was thoroughly proficient.</p>
    <p>But when her mother took a look, she still shook her head.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>Sushang couldn’t understand what the problem was. Was she not training hard enough?</p>
    <p>Why wasn’t she meeting her mother’s expectations?</p>
  </text>
  <text>One day, Sushang eavesdropped on her parents’ conversation at night.</text>
  <transition mode="clock" in="1" stop="0.5" out="1" color="#000000"></transition>
  <bg img="忆剑山庄内"></bg>
  <dialog chara="009">「In my opinion, the problem is your Li family’s martial arts.」</dialog>
  <text>Her mother spoke coldly.</text>
  <dialog chara="009">
    <p>「Fleeting Swallow and 13 Stances of the Diving Swift are amazing skills in the middle of Sichuan, but how about Master’s “Edge of Taixuan”?</p>
    <p>I shouldn’t have listened to your nonsense and changed Issin Mnemonics.」</p>
  </dialog>
  <dialog chara="010">「……」</dialog>
  <text>Her father whispered something, Sushang couldn’t hear him properly, but her mother gave a cold sneer.</text>
  <dialog chara="009">「Okay, so it’s my fault now? Then I’ve wasted ten years on you in vain.」</dialog>
  <dialog chara="009">「I don’t care about you, and you don’t care about Sushang. Unlike you, she’s shown great potential in sword practice. Even if she’s not as good as Fifth Senior Sister, she’s still better than me.」</dialog>
  <text>From Sushang’s hearing outside the window, her mother sounded cold and defeated.</text>
  <dialog chara="009">
    <p>「My Blade Mantra has been damaged, your Blade Mantra can’t be cultivated, what can I say?[\s]</p>
    <p>Tomorrow, I will head to the Northern Desert and ask the Fifth Senior Sister to take Sushang as her disciple.」</p>
  </dialog>
  <dialog chara="009">「Fifth Senior Sister owes me a personal favor. My face is low, but as long as I speak, she won’t refuse.」</dialog>
  <text>Her father was taken aback, then he sternly objected. Sushang was inexplicably terrified when she heard it. She wanted to agree with her father, but she was also curious about what her mother said about 「Northern Desert」 and 「Fifth Sister」.</text>
  <dialog chara="009">「——Edge of Taixuan.」</dialog>
  <text>The short three characters seemed to have magical powers, and all the noise was eliminated as soon as they were spoken, and the room was suddenly silent.</text>
  <dialog chara="009">「Ever since Master passed away, Lingshuang alone has mastered the Essence of Eminence in this world.」</dialog>
  <dialog chara="009">「Since Sushang wants to learn swordsmanship, why not learn the best swordsmanship?」</dialog>
  <transition mode="clock" in="1" stop="0.5" out="1" color="#000000"></transition>
  <bg img="氛围-1-素裳过曝-1"></bg>
  <text>
    <p>Her mother did what she said.</p>
    <p>On the day of Sushang’s fifth birthday, her parents gave her a generous parting gift.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>Bidding goodbye to Issen Manor, bidding goodbye to Sichuan, saying goodbye to her "home".</p>
    <p>She went to the Northern Desert and learned the 「best swordsmanship」 for a whole decade.</p>

    <p>Ten years had suddenly passed.</p>
    <p>No longer did she yearn for her home, the only thing she still bears in her heart is her mother’s bidding.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>Has her swordsmanship improved?</p>
    <p>Has her martial arts techniques improved?</p>
    <p>Does her current self finally meet her mother’s expectations?</p>
  </text>
  <text>…Sushang doesn’t know, she still needs proof.</text>
  <motion chara="002" action="img_trans" img="素裳-专注-持剑-远景"></motion>
  <text>And the way to prove it, is through a『Sword Trial』.</text>
