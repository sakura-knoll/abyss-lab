  <text>Ancient Sword - Xuanyuan. </text>
  <text>The sword was two feet long, had a golden yellow body, double edged, and adorned with dark gray patterns. </text>
  <text>The material was unknown, made with neither refined iron nor cold steel, but it was light as air, spoke of sharpness and hardness, and was fully worthy of the standards of a famous sword. </text>

  <text>When her mother passed the sword to her, she warned: </text>
  <dialog chara="009">
    <p>[This sword was passed down by your Taixuan Grandmaster, and it’s my most cherished family heirloom. </p>
    <p>You must put it away, keep it close to your body, and never let this sword leave your side.]</p>

  <dialog chara="009">
    <p>[The true secret of [Edge of Taixuan] lies not in the techniques nor the tricks, but in this sword. </p>
    <p>After you understand Blade Sanction, you will understand what your mother means.]</p>

  <text>Qin Suyi said, while squishing her cheeks, then gently spoke: </text>
  <dialog chara="009">[...But if you can’t comprehend it, it doesn’t matter. [\s]Blade Sanction is unpredictable, only your master ever cultivated this Essence out of the seven of us; but in terms of martial art prowess, who of us could compare?]</dialog>
  <text>Her mother sighed suddenly: </text>
  <dialog chara="009">[Lingshuang has always been indifferent, and had contempt for profit… but after ten years, people can change.]</dialog>
  <dialog chara="009">

    <p>Her mother’s expectations were right, Master really asked her for the Xuanyuan Sword.[\s]</p>
    <p>Sushang was honest in nature, after thinking about it, she still handed over the ancient sword with both hands. </p>
  </mono>
  <text>
    <p>Master would never bully a five year old girl, and steal something right?[\s]</p>
    <p>She presented the Xuanyuan Sword to her Master, excitement filling up her heart, like a girl excitedly showing off her new clothes. </p>

  <text>
    <p>Old Seventh… Sushang was startled, before remembering that she and her mother came from the same sect, ranking seventh. [\s]</p>

  <text>
    <p>But to Sushang’s eyes, that was an infinitely long second. [\s]</p>
    <p>She had been with the sword since childhood, but she never thought that it was such a beautiful thing before. </p>
