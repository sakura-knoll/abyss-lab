  <text>
    <p>Special attacks, divine skills, strategy- not a trace of such things could be found.</p>
    <p>All she saw was tense and monotonous attacks like a rush of surging waves and defenses that gradually formed traps.</p>
  </text>
  <text>...This wasn't the duel Li Sushang had envisioned.</text>

    <p>Her eyes were already used to 「Eagle」’s martial arts</p>
    <p>Having looked at it with the 「Sword Heart」 till now,</p>
    <p>She found a way to fight back.</p>

  <text>
    <p>「Eagle」’s right fist was completely powerless, clearly a feint.[\s]</p>
    <p>However, the diversion wasn’t meant to lure in enemies or defend against them—it was actually a half-assed move that only gave him enough time to prepare</p>

  <text>
    <p>Sushang had been waiting for that brief moment.</p>
    <p>With a single 「Sword Transformation:Cloud Eagle」, she switched from defense to offense</p>
    <p>In an instant, she used 「Open Sword: Instant Dust」 and stabbed it into「Eagle」's throat.</p>
  </text>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>The Void Sword extended with its physical form.[\s]</p>
    <p>When the weilder held a sword in your hand, this technique would become a merciless move that imbues the sword with internal energy, aiming straight for the enemy’s throat.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>With Li Sushang's speed, her opponent had no other option but to take the sword forcefully.</p>
    <p>She used her fingers instead of a sword, preparing for 「Eagle」’s return move.</p>

    <p>However, 「Eagle」 neither defended nor evaded.[\s]</p>

  <dialog chara="002">（Huh...!?）</dialog>
  <text>Sushang was shocked, not having expected this development at all...</text>
  <text>An enemy taking the initiative to show an opening could only mean two things: they either gave up on resisting or were prepared to launch a suicide attack.</text>
  <text>
    <p>The closer one got to victory, the more dangerous it would become.</p>
    <p>People close to death often act in unexpected ways.</p>
  </text>
  <text>However, all Sushang's mind contained was panic and confusion.</text>

  <text>
    <p>「「Open Sword: Instant Dust」」 was extremely fast, and it didn't give her time to think.</p>
    <p>The sword extended with its physical form. If 「Eagle」 didn't respond, he would probably die in an instant!</p>

  <text>
    <p>Just in the nick of time, Li Sushang suddenly realized something.</p>
    <p>To tell the truth, she hadn't been prepared.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>She didn’t have the resolve to wield a sword, fight her way out or kill anyone...</p>
    <p>She was nothing more than a fifteen-year old girl who thought she’d stepped into the martial arts world, but wasn't able to abandon her respect for people and their lives.</p>
  </text>
  <dialog chara="002">「--!」</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>Facing an evildoer who was about to die at her own hands...</p>
    <p>The bet of her head, payback for the slap— everything vanished from her mind in an instant.</p>
    <p>Li Sushang gritted her teeth and decided to withdraw the technique—</p>

    <p>The sword was abruptly withdrawn,</p>
    <p>which led to a great recoil force on her body, and excruciating pain in her arm.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>To disperse the power of her technique, she lightly tapped her toes</p>
    <p>All she could do was use 「Flying Swallow Returning to the Nest」 and use the rotation to whittle down its power.</p>

  <text>
    <p>At the same time as Sushang pulled back her technique...</p>
    <p>「Eagle」’s left hand suddenly pulled out the 「Xuanyuan Sword」 and slashed upward.</p>
    <p>If the girl hadn’t stepped back, her body would have been cut in half with a single slash.</p>
