    <p>This is a tiny "stop" in the desert.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>1400 years ago, wandering Tuik people discovered an oasis here.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>They gave thanks to the gods for their protection, drank water to their heart’s content, and soon left.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono inline="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>300 years later, a caravan from Yan Kingdom passed this place.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono inline="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>The caravan carried jewelry, jade, cotton and silk brocade, accompanied by a diplomatic envoy.</p>
    <p>The value of this person was worth more than the sum of the caravan’s goods, because he shouldered the important mission of traveling to the Western Regions, communicating, and building alliances.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The merchants rested at this stop, and took off the next day.</p>
    <p>But they never made it out of the Northern Desert and no one knew their whereabouts.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono inline="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>740 years ago, the Banyu nomads set up a camp here.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The patriarch told her people: 「Because of this water source, the Banyu people shall never have to wander again.」</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>100 years later, the Huns came from the north. They swept the Banyu village, killed all the old and middle-aged men, took all the women and young children, and went to the remote Western Regions.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>……The oasis was left behind by the Huns, forgotten once more by the world.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>Years passed by unhurried and there was change.[\s]</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Civilizations rose and fell; humans came and went, but they all sunk into the endless sands of the long river of history.</p>

    <p>The inhabitant of the oasis now sighed beneath the shadows of the ancient wall.[\s]</p>
    <p>This dull and sunbathed desert, he had seen the scene for three months now.</p>

    <p>The man sighed again.</p>
    <p>The desert’s heat and desolation agitates him.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>Looking around, everything in his vision remained the same;</p>
    <p>the sun, the sky, the yellow sand…… are all immobile and motionless.</p>
    <p>Even the air is stiff, there’s not a breeze around him.</p>

  <text>In the distance, his companion responded by simply shaking his head, signaling nothing out of the ordinary was spotted.</text>
  <text>
    <p>The other man knew very well the man was just starting a conversation to alleviate his boredom.</p>
    <p>But within this baking desert, talking was a luxury.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>Opening his mouth would be a waste of saliva.</p>
    <p>The guard of the 「Golden Sand Gang」 didn’t want to expend the effort.</p>

  <text>He touched the closed door and licked his lips sadly.</text>
  <text>He is still a newcomer. It’s only been a few months since he joined the 「Golden Sand Gang」, he has yet to learn all the rules. If he did, he would’ve known the value of water, would’ve spoken less, and stand still by the shadow of the ancient wall until the Boss comes back.</text>

  <dialog chara="095">「*, it’s supposed to be a big deal.」</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>The man swore out of frustration.</p>
    <p>His voice was so low, his companion couldn’t make out what he said.</p>
  </text>
  <motion chara="095" action="img_trans" img="砂匪2-中-普通"></motion>
  <text>
    <p>……He knows very well that the Boss didn’t take him lightly just because he’s new.</p>
    <p>Normally gang members take turns looking after their base, it just so happens today is his turn.</p>
  </text>
  <text>Even though the Golden Sand Gang will still reward him all the same despite him staying back to protect the base.</text>
  <text>
    <p>But- he is a fighter, a real killer.</p>
    <p>Robbing, looting, kidnapping, murdering… These are what he signed up to do.</p>
    <p>The clashes of blades and the slicing of flesh… Those are the real rewards he seeks.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>[em bold color=#ff0000]Battle[/em] and [em bold color=#ff0000]Killing[/em]; these are the things that the man values.[\s]</p>
    <p>No doubt about it, this man is the evil amongst the evil.[\s]</p>
    <p>Not only does he bear no shame in this, he prides himself with this as proof of who he really is.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>As such, being left out of such a 「Big Fish」 makes the man feel extremely</p>
    <p>humiliated and angry[\s]</p>
    <p>It’s this anger that frustrates him and makes him talkative.</p>

  <text>
    <p>The man wasn’t hallucinating, this isn’t one of those "mirages" that appear in the desert.[\s]</p>
    <p>The girl…  she’s walking slowly towards them from the other end of the desert.</p>
  </text>
  <dialog chara="095">「R-Rong——!」</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>His whisper quickly dissipated in the heat.</p>
    <p>Without realizing, he already made several big mistakes.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>First: He lost his composure.</p>
    <p>Second: He moved by himself.</p>
    <p>If this was the Big Boss, he wouldn’t have made such a big deal out of this.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>But, the Golden Sand Gang are the feared leaders of the Northern Desert.</p>
    <p>They have never met a girl that walks up to them like this.</p>
  </text>
  <text>「Who is this girl?」</text>
  <text>「Is she crazy? This place belongs to the Golden Sand Gang!」</text>
  <text>「Who dares look for trouble here? And crosses the Golden Sand Gang?」</text>
  <text>…Questions after questions flashed across his mind like lightning.</text>
