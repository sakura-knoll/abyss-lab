  <text>She cleared her throat, looking shyly at the Raksha. She saw the latter staring at her intently, and she suddenly felt tiny sparks of joy inside her. She straightened her back, and her tone became more serious.</text>

  <text>Sushang felt a bit guilty being so boastful, </text>

  <dialog chara="001">[Mhm.]</dialog>
  <motion chara="002" action="img_trans" img="素裳-大笑-背手-中景"></motion>

  <text>She forgot that she was still cuffed, so her attempt to separate her arms only hurt her.</text>
  <text>The [Ki Suppressant Pill] that the Golden Sand Gang had given her was quite the poison indeed. She could feel the Ki in her lower Dantian Sea, but it refused to flow into her veins. She had all the Ki she needed, but no way to use it.</text>
  <text inline="true">— However, the girl had learned the [Edge of Taixuan]. </text>
  <text>
    <p></p>
    <p>Phoenix’s martial arts were different from the thousands of others in these lands.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>Normally, the arts would train the Dantian to store the Qi, </p>
    <p>but the [Edge of Taixuan] wasn’t so strict about that.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>The one who had learned the [Blade Mantra] </p>
    <p>could see the world as their Dantian Sea and their body as the veins. </p>
    <p>The [Ki] that was the origin point of martial arts had no need to be buried within oneself.</p>
  </text>
  <text>That’s why to Li Sushang, her lower Dantian Sea being blocked was a bit uncomfortable, but it was nothing too serious.</text>

    <p>Sushang felt her limbs lighten as soon as his voice faded. The two pairs of thick steel cuffs had already shattered into pieces on the ground. [\s]</p>

  <text>Li Sushang couldn’t figure out what to say. She’d already seen so many strange things from the moment she laid eyes on this Raksha beauty. </text>

  <text>She didn’t believe it.</text>
  <text>
    <p>The experts and masters in her eyes were ones like her master, her mother, or herself in the future, </p>

    <p>It’s almost as if the outlander in the cell was even scarier than 「Eagle」.</p>

    <p>The even stranger thing was that 「Eagle」 was not angry at all, like he usually would be.</p>

    <p>But either way, the bandits didn’t underestimate the man and split into day and night guards to ensure that there would always be at least five people guarding the cell.</p>
