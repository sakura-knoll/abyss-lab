  <text>Thump. </text>
  <text>Li Sushang fell and rolled across the ground.</text>
  <dialog chara="002">[Ngh—]</dialog>
  <text>Although she wasn’t hurt, Li Sushang still cried out by instinct. The soft voice of a young girl changed its tune as it passed through the dirty rag in her mouth, becoming a quiet wail.</text>
  <text>A couple of bandits laughed outside, their words vile and full of obscenities.</text>

  <text>
    <p>Click. [\s]</p>
    <p>The door was locked.</p>
  </text>
  <text>The flickering light of the torch disappeared with the footsteps, leaving the little girl in the Dark Dungeon.</text>
  <text>
    <p>Sushang wriggled her body, attempting to sit upright; [\s]</p>
    <p>her eyes hadn’t yet adjusted to the darkness, so she couldn’t see anything, but her legs seemed to have brushed against something while she was squirming around.</p>

  <text>It was a woman, about 20 years old. Her skin was snowy white, elegant features adorning her figure. She didn’t look like someone from Shenzhou at all, but rather the legendary celestials.</text>
  <text>The small flame hovered next to her ear, giving off an even more ominous vibe.</text>
  <text>
    <p>[em italic]A Raksha…[/em][\s]</p>
    <p>Li Sushang remembered the whispers of the bandits.[\s]</p>
    <p>[em italic]So this is what a Raksha looks like.[/em]</p>

  <text>
    <p>She looked to the woman’s side and saw a large coffin. </p>
    <p>That was the large hunk of wood that Sushang had almost kicked.</p>
  </text>
  <text>Coffins were not an uncommon sight, nor were they a taboo subject. Regardless, even someone who had heard many frightening stories like Sushang couldn’t help but feel chills crawling down her spine. It was a terrifying object to come upon in this moment, while she was trapped in a dark dungeon.</text>
  <text>
    <p>She moved her gaze by instinct, focusing on the Raksha woman again.</p>
    <p>At first, she only stole a few glances, but after seeing no reaction from her, she began to look her up and down.</p>

  <text>The Raksha ignored her rude gaze and simply shook the glass container in her hand.</text>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托地牢_看人"></cg>
  <dialog chara="002">[Mmmmmph?]</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>She forgot that she was still gagged, so her words became a pile of gibberish. [\s]</p>
    <p>Li Sushang looked embarrassed, but luckily, the dim atmosphere was doing her many favors right now.</p>
  </text>
  <text>She gestured at the woman, trying to get her to remove the rag in her mouth.</text>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托地牢_看杯"></cg>
  <text>
    <p>Li Sushang blinked several times, but the woman ignored all of her attempts, choosing instead to continue lounging around.</p>
    <p>She tried exchanging a few glances with her, all of them were ignored. The woman didn't react in the slightest</p>
  </text>
  <dialog chara="002">（This guy —)</dialog>
  <text>A thought suddenly entered Li Sushang's mind, and she raised her feet, preparing to kick the coffin.</text>

  <text>
    <p>As the fire appeared once more, Li Sushang looked at the Raksha sitting next to the wall. [\s]</p>
    <p>She was still in her original position, but this time, her eyes had a sliver of annoyance.</p>

  <dialog chara="002">
    <p></p>
    <p>[You’re a man?]</p>
  </dialog>
  <text>The two spoke at the same time, and then paused at the same time.</text>
  <text>
    <p>The Raksha stopped talking, silently affirming her statement. </p>
    <p>On the other hand, Li Sushang couldn’t stop talking:</p>
  </text>
  <dialog chara="002">
    <p>[Me? I wasn’t trying to do anything. I just wanted you to take the rag out of my mouth. </p>
    <p>Thanks. You’re a good person. You’re just… A little girly.]</p>
  </dialog>
  <dialog chara="002">
    <p>[I owe you one now, so I’ll definitely repay you in the future. </p>
    <p>As soon as I focus and get these cuffs off, I’ll help you — Where are your cuffs?!]</p>
  </dialog>
  <text>
    <p>Unlike Li Sushang, who was cuffed and gagged, </p>
    <p>the Raksha had nothing of the sort on him.</p>
  </text>
  <text>Even worse, he was sitting on a fancy chair and sipping a red liquid out from a small glass cup. He looked as elegant as one could be in this moment.</text>
  <dialog chara="002">[Aren’t… Aren’t you a prisoner?]</dialog>

  <text>Without a word, the Raksha stood up, the chair and the glass disappearing like melting snow in the fire light.</text>

  <text>Li Sushang looked pale.</text>
  <text>
    <p>She wasn’t afraid of a lot of things, but she respected the mystical and divine. [\s]</p>
    <p>The little trick that the Raksha just pulled scared her to death, so much so that she dropped all pretenses as a vigilante heroine.</p>

  <text>Her scream was long and shrill, echoing in the cell, but nobody said a thing, nor did they bother to come and see what was going on. [\s]The Raksha waited for her to stop and look at her own shadow cast by the flame before speaking:</text>

  <text>The Raksha didn’t say a thing. It was hard to tell if he’d even understood what she said. </text>
  <text>Li Sushang stole a glance at the man, taking her time to marvel at his handsomeness. She didn’t think he looked like a bad person, and as her thoughts got carried away, she began coming up with legendary backstories for this Raksha.</text>
