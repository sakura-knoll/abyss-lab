  <text>「Eagle」 stepped forward, looking at the girl in front of him, with a lot of doubts in his mind:</text>
  <text>What was the origin of this girl?!</text>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>Looking at the entire Northern Desert, there wasn't anyone not afraid of his Golden Sand Gang.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>Even the most elite officers and soldiers thought his rule was far and hard, and never conflicted with it.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>Who had the guts of a bear-hearted leopard and dared to break through the door, becoming an enemy of 「Eagle」?</p>
  </mono>
  <text>He couldn't figure it out.</text>
  <motion chara="002" action="img_trans" img="素裳-标准-背手-远景"></motion>
  <text>And—the one who came was still a little girl, she looked at most sixteen years old, her childishness was still there, and there was the youthful spirit of youth in her eyes.</text>
  <text>And—— her martial arts wasn't bad, even surprisingly good. 「Eagle」’s most prided men went into battle, but the four of them failed to capture her.</text>
  <text>What was the origin of this girl?!</text>
  <text inline="true">「Eagle」 wanted to ask a question. But unexpectedly, it wasn't him who spoke first.</text>

  <text inline="true">「Eagle」 raised his hand and slapped Sushang hard, causing the words to be stuck in her throat.</text>
  <text>
    <p></p>
    <p>In his turf, he was the only one who got to speak first, and he asked questions first.</p>

  <text>The girl raised her head, blood flowing from the corners of her mouth.</text>

  <text>
    <p>「Eagle」 wiped his hands and squatted in front of the girl. </p>
    <p>The girl also looked up at him, there was no fear in her eyes, only stubbornness and annoyance.</p>
  </text>
  <motion chara="015" action="show" pos="center" img="老鹰-微笑-叉腰-中景"></motion>
  <text>「Eagle」 held her chin before saying:</text>
  <dialog chara="015">
    <p>[I don't know who you are or what your goal is; </p>
    <p>originally I was a little interested. </p>
    <p>So I thought I might as well listen to your intentions and if you could make me laugh, I might have been compassionate.]</p>
  </dialog>
  <motion chara="015" action="img_trans" img="老鹰-普通-叉腰-中景"></motion>
  <dialog chara="015">[...Now, you have lost this chance.]</dialog>
  <text>「Eagle」 stared at the girl's eyes, the tears still remaining, enjoying the pleasure of punishing the enemy. </text>
  <text>This wasn't his style, but after meeting with the Raksha, his heart was full of boredom. Even knowing that threats and intimidation were meaningless, he continued.</text>
  <motion chara="015" action="img_trans" img="老鹰-普通-抱胸NO刀-中景"></motion>
  <dialog chara="015" inline="true">
    <p>[Next time, you have to know when you can speak and when you can't;  </p>

  <dialog chara="015">[You are young and good-looking. If trained, you'll definitely be liked by them. To be honest, I intend to sell you at a good price, so you have a few days to be safe. But don't be too happy too soon.]</dialog>

  </dialog>
  <text>After that, 「Eagle」 glanced at the captive, and was disappointed. </text>
  <text>
    <p>The girl sniffed and nodded seriously at him without saying a word. </p>
    <p>Among the various reactions, it was the one that made him speechless.</p>
  </text>
  <motion chara="015" action="hide"></motion>
  <text>「Eagle」 pushed Sushang away, wiped his hands on his clothes in disgust, and turned to the subordinate on the side:</text>

  <text>The sudden question made the man sweat, and caused him to stutter.</text>
  <dialog chara="015">
    <p>[Since then, you have been restless… </p>
    <p>...What do you want to say? Speak.’</p>

  <dialog chara="095">[Yes, it's just that, boss... This girl, she, she's pretty good... Let's still take precautions…]</dialog>
  <motion chara="015" action="img_trans" img="老鹰-撩发-远景"></motion>
  <text>「Eagle」 glanced at the man in disgust, who was frightened to take a step back.</text>
  <dialog chara="015">[You served her the [Ki Suppressant Pill].]</dialog>
  <dialog chara="095">[Yes...yes, she did not resist at all. We were worried...she had ulterior motives and would be dangerous.]</dialog>

  <dialog chara="015">[A teenage girl, with both hands bound in shackles, and she can't use of her internal strength either.]</dialog>

  <motion chara="095" action="hide" duration="0"></motion>
  <dialog chara="095">[Your subordinate was wrong!]</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>The man lost his soul and knelt down quickly. </p>
    <p>He knew that the more gentle and calm the gang leader's tone, the more furious he became.</p>
  </text>
  <motion chara="015" action="img_trans" img="老鹰-普通-抱胸NO刀-远景"></motion>
  <dialog chara="015">[……]</dialog>
  <text>「Eagle」 was very angry in his heart, but  his face remained calm. This was a habit he had cultivated for many years. </text>
  <text>The Raksha upset him, the little girl annoyed him; the self-assertion of his subordinates made him vaguely feel that his authority had been challenged.</text>
  <dialog chara="015">[Take her... put her in the Dark Dungeon, and lock her up with the Raksha.]</dialog>
  <dialog chara="015">[They are not allowed to have food, and they must be kept hungry until the slavers take them away.]</dialog>
  <dialog chara="-1">[Yes!]</dialog>
  <text>The bandits responded in unison, pulled the girl up, and pushed her to the Dark Dungeon.</text>
  <motion chara="015" action="img_trans" img="老鹰-普通-玩玉-远景"></motion>
  <dialog chara="015">[……Um?]</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>The man who had just kneeled on the ground did not leave. </p>
    <p>He bowed his head, not daring to look up, but the trembling of his body had already revealed his tension.</p>
  </text>
  <dialog chara="015">[What else do you want to say?]</dialog>
  <motion chara="095" action="show" pos="left" img="砂匪2-远-微笑" reversex="true"></motion>
  <text>The man straightened up as if he had received a pardon, showing a little excited smile.</text>
  <dialog chara="095">[This subordinate wants to dedicat a treasure to the leader. I hope it can make up for my misgivings.]</dialog>
  <text>As he spoke, he magically took out a cloth bag and presented it with both hands.</text>
  <text>「Eagle」 didn't stretch out his hand, didn't even look at the cloth bag, and asked:</text>
  <motion chara="015" action="img_trans" img="老鹰-普通-抱胸NO刀-远景"></motion>
  <dialog chara="015">[What's inside? Where did it come from?]</dialog>
  <dialog chara="095">"A sword that cuts iron like mud, taken from that little girl."</dialog>

  <motion chara="095" action="img_trans" img="砂匪2-远-普通" reversex="true"></motion>
  <text inline="true">[……]</text>
  <text>「Eagle」 still didn't pick it up. The man also maintained his posture, and didn't dare to move an inch.</text>
  <motion chara="015" action="img_trans" img="老鹰-微笑-玩玉-远景"></motion>
  <text>
    <p>After a long time, 「Eagle」 smiled suddenly, reached out his hand to take the cloth bag, and slowly untied the cloth wrapped around it, revealing the true face of the sword. [\s]</p>
    <p>He had confirmed that the man in front of him had not concealed or lied, that was enough.</p>
