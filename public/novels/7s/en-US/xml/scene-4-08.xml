    <p>Therefore, when meeting the Raksha,</p>
    <p>the「Eagle」suddenly had the illusion of time repeating itself.</p>

  <text>
    <p>At first sight of this person,「Eagle」's back went abruptly cold, </p>
    <p>An alarm bell sounded instinctively, telling him that this man was a 「scourge」.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>At the time, the「Scourge」stayed in the caravan's carriage and enjoyed a small cabin exclusively.</p>
    <p>Among the dozens of caravans, he was the only one who enjoyed this extraordinary treatment.</p>

  <text>When「Eagle」's sword brushed up the screen, the Raksha was talking to something.</text>
  <dialog chara="001">Raksha:「Mach dir keine sorgen」(Don't worry)</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>The man knelt on one knee. His tone was calm and easy-going, as if he was asking a close travel companion, but looking around;</p>
    <p>There was no one else in the compartment, only a coffin.</p>
  </text>
  <text>Only him, and a coffin.</text>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托出场2"></cg>
  <dialog chara="001">Raksha:「Ich werde lösen」(I'll take care of it.)</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>This person wasn't speaking in Raksha language, and「Eagle」couldn't understand it.</p>
    <p>But this strange and terrifying scene had him sweating bullets.</p>
  </text>
  <text>He couldn't help but look up at the weird man who was talking to the coffin:</text>
  <transition mode="eye" in="1" stop="0.5" out="1" color="#000000"></transition>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托出场2" scale="3" origin="40%,80%"></cg>
  <delay t="0.1"></delay>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托出场2" scale="3" pos="0,500" origin="45%,80%" duration="30"></cg>
  <text>
    <p>The Raksha person was about twenty years old, tall and not strong looking.</p>
    <p>He obviously had some skills, but he was definitely not a master.</p>
  </text>
  <text>Just by observing his appearance and shape, you could know a little about what martial arts a person trained in.</text>
  <text>
    <p>If you had bulging muscles, you were a martial artist who practices Waijiaquan.</p>
    <p>This martial arts allowed one's fist and feet strikes to break gold and gravel, and it was no problem to resist ordinary blunt weapons.</p>
  </text>
  <text>But「Eagle」did not put such people in his eyes.</text>
  <text>
    <p>Truly skilled people emphasized balance throughout the whole body. Blindly insisting on fierce effort would lead to a loss of flexibility.</p>
    <p>A truly skilled person was one who possessed both speed and strength.</p>
  </text>
  <text>And masters of inner power had another set of tricks.</text>
  <text>
    <p>Inner martial arts exercised inner strength, that is, meridians and 「Zhen Qi」.</p>
    <p>Though the appearance of such a person would be modest, their presence would be strong. Observing one's gaze and breathing, it was possible to gauge the depth of one's inner strength.</p>
  </text>
  <text>Needless to say,「Eagle」saw through the Raksha man's strength at a glance, and found it to be of no significance, and from his chaotic breathing rhythm, it was apparent that this man had never learned superior internal skills either.</text>

  <dialog chara="015">Eagle:「Come out.」</dialog>
  <text>「Eagle」 said, his hand dropping on the handle of his scimitar.</text>
  <text>He hated the Raksha the most, and it wass even more unlucky to see a coffin in the daytime. The two taboos merge into one, and 「Eagle」 had an impulse to see blood.</text>
  <text>
    <p>He was already full of blood debts, so why not add another life?</p>
    <p>But... the scimitar was not out of its sheath.</p>

  <text>His eyes were green like jade, like two carefully polished emeralds.</text>
  <dialog chara="015">Eagle:「……」</dialog>
  <text>Somehow, a warning sounded in 「Eagle」's heart again.</text>
  <transition mode="fade" in="1" stop="0.5" out="1" color="#000000"></transition>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托出场2"></cg>
  <text>The Raksha man calmly asked in a lame but clear Chinese dialect:</text>
  <dialog chara="001">Raksha:「Arrive?」</dialog>
  <text>This question had no background and was too inexplicable, but 「Eagle」 nodded.</text>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托出场1"></cg>
  <text>The Raksha man pointed to the ground:</text>
  <dialog chara="001">Raksha:「Here, yours?」</dialog>
  <dialog chara="015">「Eagle」:「This is mine, and you are mine too. Come out .」</dialog>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_奥托出场1"></cg>
  <dialog chara="001">Raksha:「Mmm……」</dialog>
  <text>The Raksha didn't say anything, but slowly stretched out, struggling to support his knees with his hands, as if having a hard time getting up.</text>
  <text>
    <p>[em italic]This Raksha, acting like he's a big deal.[/em]</p>
    <p>「Eagle」couldn't help cursing in his heart. </p>
    <p>[em italic]I can't wait to see what kind of expression you will show if I sell you to a Baihui Slave trader.[/em]</p>
  </text>
  <text>He suddenly missed the past. Ten years ago, he would have already taken the scimitar out and chopped off this beautiful head. </text>
  <text>
    <p>Dead Rakshas were worthless, but the living Rakshas were rare goods.</p>
    <p>Baihui slave traders prefer them, and they always gave a good price.</p>
  </text>
  <text>「Eagle」looked at the obedient Raksha, suddenly a little curious.</text>
  <text>
    <p>Why did he speak to the coffin?</p>
    <p>This person occupied a whole room alone, how mysterious...</p>
    <p>Yes, he didn't want people to know what was in the coffin.</p>
  </text>
  <text>Then…… what was in it?</text>
  <text>
    <p></p>
    <p>……What would it be? ?</p>

  <text>
    <p>「Eagle」had seen countless people in his life,</p>
    <p>And the eyes he had seen were countless.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>Fear, hatred, anger, unwillingness, pain…… </p>
    <p>He had not only seen it, but was often the source of all these emotions.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>A blade on the neck was the best truth serum in the world, </p>
    <p>it could completely expose a person's deepest heart.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>「Eagle」was numb to dying eyes, </p>
    <p>and was indifferent to their dying emotions.</p>
    <p>He had seen too many of those.</p>

    <p>However, there had never been a look like the one in the eyes of this Raksha, </p>

    <p>「Eagle」gave a chuckle in his heart and swallowed and spit.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>This Raksha man didn't out him in his eyes at all.</p>
    <p>In the eyes of this person,「Eagle」, leader of the Golden Sand Gang , was no different than a grain of sand in the desert.</p>
    <p>He had neither value nor meaning.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>He even had the illusion that in the next second, the Raksha would walk over this grain of sand,</p>
    <p>And it would be as natural as a stroll.</p>

  <text>
    <p>'It's not because I'm afraid',「Eagle」told himself:</p>
    <p>He would never be afraid of a Raksha.</p>
  </text>
  <text>However, the feeling in his heart was more shame than fear, and he even wanted to run away from the person in front of him.</text>
