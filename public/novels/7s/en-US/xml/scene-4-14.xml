  <text>It was deep into the night, yet 「Eagle」 wasn’t tired.</text>
  <text>The parlor of the dilapidated Stop was brightly lit, making the light and shadows divide the yard outside of the hall into two. </text>
  <text>「Eagle」stood in the yard. His eight most trusted subordinates stood nearby, watching him sword dancing.  </text>

  <text>「Eagle」 was no swordsman, nor was he proficient in swordsmanship. He was once a member of the military, and learned greatsword techniques. </text>
  <text>
    <p>Sword and greatsword techniques appeared the same, but they were, in fact completely different.</p>
    <p>As people say [Swords are quick, greatswords are strong.] Swords travelled with trickery, flexible yet varying; greatswords were fair, breaking through with power. </p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>When a sword wielder was given a greatsword, they would use it like a sword, and the same applied vice versa. </p>
    <p>Therefore, although 「Eagle」 looked like he was sword dancing, he was actually greatsword dancing.</p>

  <text inline="true">The reason why he had the sword, was because the sword is really satisfying.</text>
  <text>
    <p></p>
    <p>He had never seen such a perfect blade!</p>

  <text>「Eagle」 hauled the sword in his hand, his movement swift. Suddenly his wrist quivered, and three sword flowers bloomed.</text>

  <text inline="true">It seemed to be like an ink filled brush. Wherever the sword went, dark gray lines were left behind in the air, like freehand calligraphy. </text>
  <text>
    <p></p>
    <p>This was exactly like the beauty of the sword’s patterns, very gratifying.</p>
  </text>
  <se id="01-27大刀横挥"></se>
  <text inline="true">「Eagle」 stabbed sharply with the sword, and exerted strength from his wrist. The sword’s body didn’t move, yet the sword edge seemed to quiver slightly, singing with the sound of a soft hum. </text>
  <text>
    <p></p>
    <p>This fit the firmness of the sword’s body, sturdiness and softness.</p>
  </text>
  <se id="01-21轩辕剑氛围声"></se>
  <cg></cg>
  <text inline="true">The sword slowed down so much that it appeared to have stopped. The blade was placed next to his chest, emitting an overwhelmingly cold and sharp light.</text>
  <text>
    <p></p>
    <p>This showed the strength of the sword’s light. The light was so cold that it penetrated through bones. </p>

  <text>「Eagle」 couldn’t help but laugh heartily, and he pulled out a string of hair and held it above the blade. When he let it go, the hair split to two. </text>
  <text>This was just how sharp the sword was: so sharp that it would cut falling hair.</text>
  <text>If it had the four aforementioned traits, this sword could be considered as legendary. </text>

    <p>Even if he spoke words of praise, it was nothing more than a bandit admiring his spoils. </p>

  <text>A person who knew goods well would be able to tell that this sword on the girl’s body was worth more than silver or gold.</text>
  <text inline="true">But he was still a warrior. </text>
  <text>Famous swords were like beautiful jades since ancient times, and whoever won them would be admired.</text>
  <text>「Eagle」 decided to keep it. Not because it had anything to do with gold or silver, but rather as a symbol of status.</text>
  <text>After all, a figure like him, should have a weapon that matches.</text>

  <text>「Eagle」 was shocked, and instinctively backed away six feet.</text>
  <text>
    <p>He couldn’t believe the scene in front of his eyes.[\s]</p>
    <p>Eight men were lying on the ground, all unconscious. </p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>And the girl that he ordered to be taken to the Dark Dungeon, was blinking at him.[\s]</p>
    <p>[em italic]WHAT HAPPENED!?!?[/em]</p>
  </text>
  <text>…If this was a joke, he would cut the mastermind into pieces, and feed them to a horse.</text>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_鹰李对峙_鹰惊李伸手" duration="2"></cg>
  <text>But the girl appeared fearless, stretching her hands:</text>
  <dialog chara="002">[Hey, you’ve played enough with it, so it’s time to give it back to me now.] </dialog>
  <dialog chara="015">「...Don't be ridiculous!」</dialog>
  <text>「Eagle」 was already distraught, but the girl’s dialogue made him even more irritated.</text>
  <text>He didn’t like the feeling of being confused about the circumstances, and he wanted to regain control of the situation.</text>
  <dialog chara="015">[...How did you escape?]</dialog>
  <dialog chara="002">[Oh, it was the Raksha who helped me out… Eh, where did he go?]</dialog>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_鹰李对峙_鹰惊李普通_呆滞" duration="2"></cg>
  <text>The girl turned her head, her back, and looked around.</text>
  <dialog chara="015">[※※, damn that Raksha!]</dialog>
  <cg duration="2" img="CG_第一折_鹰李对峙_鹰惊李普通_呆滞"></cg>
  <text>
    <p>「Eagle」 cursed at himself viciously in his mind.[\s]</p>
    <p>If you were aware of a『hazard』, then it would be better to get rid of it as soon as possible.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>It was precisely because hazards were feared, that hazards often caused problems.[\s]</p>
    <p>「Eagle」 regretted not paying attention to the strange Raksha, but at this moment, regret was no longer helpful.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>He stepped back quietly, forming a safe distance for dialogue. This was actually unnecessary, because he was the one holding the sword.[\s]</p>
    <p>…But, it wasn’t the girl Eagle was worried about.</p>
  </text>
  <text>At this moment, the moon shone brightly. The shadows reflected by the throbbing candlelight danced wildly on the bluestone floor, and it was a good time to solve the problem. </text>
  <dialog chara="015">[What about that Raksha? …Where is he?]</dialog>
  <cg duration="2" img="CG_第一折_鹰李对峙_鹰惊李伸手"></cg>
  <dialog chara="002">[I don’t know.]</dialog>
  <text>The girl was telling the truth, she seemed to not know what lies were. </text>
  <motion chara="002" action="img_trans" img="素裳-专注-抱手-中景"></motion>
  <dialog chara="002">[He was behind me, but he suddenly disappeared.]</dialog>
  <text>This truly was the worst answer.[\s]In fact, 「Eagle」 didn’t pay attention to the girl at all. [\s]No matter how good an opponent’s martial arts was, it was impossible for him to lose to such a straightforward kid. </text>
  <text>
    <p>From the beginning to the end, he regarded that Raksha as his biggest threat. </p>
    <p>And being unable to grasp that person’s movements made him anxious. </p>
  </text>
  <text>The Raksha may have disappeared faraway, or may be hiding somewhere just waiting for an opportunity— but no matter what it was, a thorn was always in his heart. He wouldn’t feel at ease until he took him out.</text>
  <dialog chara="002">[Hey, don’t look for him, your opponent right now is me.]</dialog>
  <cg duration="2" img="CG_第一折_鹰李对峙_鹰惊李抱拳_哼"></cg>
  <text>The girl retracted her outstretched hand, her palm was over her fist.</text>
  <dialog chara="002">[I’m gonna take my sword back now~ Eldest Disciple of Wanderer’s House Li Sushang, please enlighten me!]</dialog>
  <bgm looptimes="0"></bgm>
  <text>Though the words were inappropriate for the present moment, she spoke anyway, making a strange pose.</text>

  <cg img="CG_第一折_起手姿势_1" duration="2" scale="1.2"></cg>

  <text>Quicker than words could tell, he felt pain in his forearm, and the sword dropped from his hand. </text>

  <se id="01-23腿部命中"></se>
  <motion chara="-4" action="shake" duration="0.1" range="50" direction="default"></motion>
  <text>He took another palm to the chest.</text>
  <text>「Eagle」 staggered back a few steps, hurriedly adjusting his breath, but his inner organs were in turmoil, and it was difficult to calm down.</text>
  <bg img="废弃驿站院内" duration="0.5"></bg>
  <motion chara="015" action="show" pos="center" img="老鹰-惊讶-肉搏备战-中景"></motion>
  <dialog chara="015">[...You!]</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>Since this palm wasn’t powered by internal force, though it was heavy, since it didn’t hurt the internal organs after all. </p>
    <p>But the girl’s agility was something 「Eagle」 rarely saw.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>Shocked, 「Eagle」 left the Raksha behind in his mind, </p>
    <p>and decided to re-evaluate this opponent who was between ten to twenty years old.</p>
