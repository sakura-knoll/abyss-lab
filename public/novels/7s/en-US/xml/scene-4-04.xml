    <p>But this was also what the enemy expected.</p>

    <p>Due to many years in the Northern Desert, the bandits had long been familiar with this style of tricks. </p>

    <p>It would be better to say that they were the most proficient in these same tactics.</p>

    <p>The girl kicked up the sand, which was not surprising, as the enemies they faced in the past always did the same.</p>

    <p>But if she thought they would panic because of this, then she was underestimating the Sand bandits.</p>

    <p>——The「Golden Sand Gang」of the Northern Desert had been operating on Shenzhou, Ingush, and Bahai’s border for over six years. </p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>What they did was the work of bandits: robbing caravans that went to and from countries, snatching precious goods, killing men and old people, and selling women and children into slavery.</p>

  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>But compared to other bandits, the Sand bandits were more disciplined.</p>

    <p>Legend had it that the leader of the Golden Sand Gang,「Eagle」, was of a military background.</p>
    <p>However, he was relegated for unjust crimes, and his entire clan was implicated.</p>

  <text>「Eagle」came to the Northern Desert and out of rage, joined the gang and became a bandit. </text>
  <text>It only took him a day, a knife and an intelligent mind to ascend the position of the leader.</text>
  <motion chara="015" action="img_trans" img="老鹰-狞笑-扭头-远景"></motion>
  <text>No one dared to mention the name of the previous bandit leader since then.</text>

  <event action="achievement" aid="c6045ef06bed0a3f"></event>
  <text>
    <p>The gang feared「Eagle」because he was ruthless; </p>
    <p>The gang respected「Eagle」, because he always won and was undefeated.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>After becoming the new boss, he brought about earth-shaking changes to the Golden Sand Gang. </p>
  </text>
  <text>
	<p>The gang went from former bandits to becoming a small disciplined group, the overlord of the land along the border of the Northern Desert.</p>
  </text>
  <motion chara="015" action="hide" img="老鹰-普通-玩玉-远景"></motion>
  <text>
    <p>The bandits must have practiced martial arts at one point or another, and practiced diligently. </p>
    <p>After martial arts training was completed, they were trained in military arts.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>「Eagle」tirelessly taught them formations, changes, coordination, and various signals and commands. </p>
    <p>What「Eagle」wanted was not a sloppy bandit group, but an army.</p>
