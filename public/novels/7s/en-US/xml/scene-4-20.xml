    <p>“Eagle” wasn’t a swordsman, but a soldier.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>What he uses isn’t swords, but greatswords.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>Thus, whenever he holds the handle backward, he habitually turns his wrist, </p>
    <p>so that the side of the blade edge, faced the enemy. </p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>But tonight——[\s]</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Tonight, at this moment between life and death, </p>
    <p>“Eagle” had a strange idea.[\s]</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This idea took root and sprouted unknowingly when he sword danced earlier. </p>

  <mono chara="015" pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>(Swords are double edged, unlike greatswords…)</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>This was just an idea, but it was lingering.[\s]</p>
    <p>This was just an idea, but it prompted “Eagle” to give up the habit of turning his wrists at the critical moment of life and death. </p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>This saved him a split moment of time.[\s]</p>
    <p>Without this split moment, he would’ve died before the blade could’ve reached the girl. </p>

    <p>Like a bolt of lightning, the girl’s palm rushed towards his head.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>"Eagle" held the hilt of the sword and picked it up with the back of his hand. [\s]</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Swords are unlike greatswords. Swords had double edges, regardless of front and back. </p>
    <p>Though, it only spared him a split moment of time, but the end results are quite different.</p>

    <p>The sword slashed the mud flicked across the moonlight. [\s]</p>
    <p>Its edge gently touched, penetrated, and bid farewell to the girl's body, dividing her into two. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>It's as easy as cutting a piece of thin paper.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Her gaze froze staring blankly in the void, no longer moving; [\s]</p>
    <p>And that fatal palm blade stopped dead in its track midair, no longer having power to move. </p>

    <p></p>
    <p>The tyrannical inner strength that he had cultivated over the years was gone, as if it had never been born. [\s]</p>
