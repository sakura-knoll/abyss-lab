    <p>「Eagle」 was also looking for an opportunity, </p>
    <p>To this end, he planned to take the initiative to expose his flaws.</p>

    <p>「Eagle」 had already figured out the girl's temperament, </p>
    <p>and her target of attack would never turn elsewhere unless she took back that "slap".</p>

    <p>If you knew your enemy's intentions, </p>
    <p>they would no longer be a danger, but a life-saving charm instead.</p>

  <text>
    <p>While attacking with full force, 「Eagle」 only needed to guard the top of the shoulder. </p>
    <p>They were both fighting for their life, but the pressure on 「Eagle」 was much lighter than Li Sushang.</p>
  </text>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_老鹰战姿_拳血" duration="1"></cg>
  <text>
    <p>Of course, he didn't plan to fulfill any "bet", </p>
    <p>The Xuanyuan Sword would stay, and Li Sushang's life would be forfeit. [\s]</p>
    <p>For this reason, another slap did not make much of a difference.</p>
  </text>
  <text>From the beginning, this was an unfair battle.</text>

    <p>「Eagle」 did everything possible and exhausted all his special skills. The purpose was not to injure the enemy, </p>

    <p>As soon as the two sides fought, 「Eagle」 knew that this girl was young but her skills were unbelievably profound.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>Not to mention her strength and speed, just the effort of changing moves and transforming energy of Roaring Tiger freely , could make her be counted as a first-class expert in the martial arts.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>For this alone, he was far from being her match.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>If the fight dragged on, he would undoubtedly lose.</p>
    <p> ——If he follow the rules that is.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>「Eagle」 wasn’t a person who obeyed the rules. [\s]</p>
    <p>What he wanted was not to win, but to conquer.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This was the third advantage: 「Purpose」. The same was 「Victory」" </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>「Eagle」's 「Victory」 was completely different from of Li Sushang's 「Victory」.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>What the girl pursued was the victory of the "match." </p>
    <p>What 「Eagle」 wanted was the victory of the "war."</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p>"Victory of the war"... meant getting what you want, destroying what you want to destroy. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Li Sushang obeyed the rules. </p>
    <p>But 「Eagle」 used rules. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Use the opponent's "target" to protect oneself, </p>
    <p>use one’s own "flaws" to lure the enemy, </p>
    <p>and then use that sharp "sword" to kill.</p>

  <text>Sushang receded slowly, but from the lighter movements and expressions, he judged that the girl had become accustomed to his attacks.</text>
  <text>The scale of victory and defeat would not always lean towards one side, and the weight that symbolized superiority changed all the time.</text>
