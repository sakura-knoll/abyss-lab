    <p>A man laid on the golden sand, unable to move. </p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>Beads of sweat emerged all over his body, making him itchy. </p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>But he was motionless. </p>

    <p>Even through clothes, the sand was so hot to the touch, it was burning his skin. </p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>The man tried his best to focus, so he wouldn’t faint from all the heat and pain. </p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>At times like this, he always remembered what the「Eagle」 once said:</p>
    <p>If people like them were caught by imperial officers and soldiers, their chests would be branded with a red branding iron.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>A branding iron was harder than sand and hotter than the sun. Once it touched the skin, it would melt a layer of skin and leave a brand.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>That feeling,「Eagle」said: 「It's like going to hell」.</p>

    <p>Golden Sand gang members often spoke of hell, after all they were destined to meet there again.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>Hell was a scary place, and boring; there was no gold or silver, no good wine, no beautiful women.</p>
    <p>You couldn’t name a single good thing there</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>But here, as long as they succeed in today's raid, they would have whatever they want.</p>

    <p></p>
    <p>This caravan was said to be larger than ones before, and the「Eagle」had received absolutely reliable information. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The caravan from far away brought the families of the rich and nobles, and the car was full of gold and silver treasures.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>If the information was correct, in 30 minutes, all of these would belong to them. </p>

  <text>Thinking of it, he couldn't help but lift his head slightly, looking out of the corner of his eyes to the only man standing.</text>

  <text>The man looked to be in his 40s, with white streaks of hair, wrinkles, and scars on his face written with hatred.</text>
  <text>
    <p>He was actually younger, but not too young. Looking at the whole face at a glance, only the eyes stood out: those were the eyes of an eagle.</p>
    <p>He looked into the distance, as if hunting for his prey.</p>
  </text>
  <text>He was just waiting for the upcoming prey, and the ambushing Golden Sand Gang were his minions.</text>
  <text>「Eagle」—— that was his nickname, an honorific of respect and fear.</text>
  <text>As long as it was an order from「Eagle」, even if the Golden Sand Gang had to lie on scorching sand for an hour, they would follow it.</text>
  <text>
    <p>There was no need to question, no promises,</p>
    <p>As long as you followed the instructions of「Eagle」, the exchange would be——</p>
  </text>
  <text>——「Victory」.</text>

  <text>
    <p>Suddenly, a smile appeared on Eagle’s face,</p>
    <p>His eyes changed accordingly. </p>
  </text>
  <text>That pair of eyes stopped watching, and slowly turned around—— this was a signal to hunt.</text>
  <motion chara="015" action="hide" duration="2"></motion>
  <text>「Eagle」raised his hand, took a step back, and then took another step back.</text>
  <text>He was withdrawing from the sight of the caravan's guards, and his hand gesture was the signal to attack.</text>

    <p></p>
    <p>The men who had been in ambush for a long time were relieved, the most difficult stage had passed. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>From here on, there was only victory. And this victory……</p>

  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Was something they’d been waiting for a long time.</p>

  <text>It was about the height of an average person, the wood brightly painted with white lacquer and carved with ornate decorations.</text>
  <text>
    <p>From the outside, the coffin was completely sealed with no gaps present.</p>
    <p>Several black leather straps were wrapped around the body of the coffin and bound it firmly.</p>
  </text>
  <text>It seemed that the owner of this coffin had spent a lot of effort to completely isolate the contents from the outside world……</text>

  <text>That owner was in front of it at the moment.</text>
  <text>
    <p>A man with blond hair and green eyes knelt next to the coffin on one knee, sliding his slender fingers across the coffin's surface.</p>
    <p>His movements were as soft as if caressing, as if he had exhausted all his strength.</p>
  </text>
  <dialog chara="099">???: 「……」</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>This person made the coffin with his own hands, so that the contents of the coffin would be isolated from the world.</p>
    <p>It was this person who fought against the laws of the world, just to bring his beloved back to the present world. </p>
    <p>Before his wish was fulfilled, he couldn't throw himself away from the world.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>So, among the roars, shouts, and crying from afar;</p>
    <p>among the wailing of camels, the overturning of carriages, the slashing of swords——</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>——The man was motionless.</p>
    <p>It seemed that everything except this coffin had nothing to do with him.</p>
  </text>
  <text>It had nothing to do with him……</text>
