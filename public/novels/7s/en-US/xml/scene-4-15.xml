    <p>“Eagle” felt a sudden urge to kill, along with the surging desire of vengeance. </p>

    <p></p>
    <p>Not only did he want to kill Li Sushang, he wanted to give her a miserable death.</p>

    <p>Maintaining the posture for facing an enemy,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The leader of the Golden Sand Gang cautioned himself,</p>
    <p>He genuinely branded the girl in front of him as a [strong enemy]. </p>

    <p>This was war.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>Not a match, not a duel, but a war.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>Though the scale was small, the goal was simple, but it was war.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Therefore,</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>This place was a battlefield where “Eagle” was the best in,</p>
    <p>Now it was war time that “Eagle” was most used to.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Within a few seconds, his mind ran wild, and he already calculated the disadvantages, advantages, and variables.</p>

  <cg></cg>
  <mono>There’s one disadvantage, it was the [Strength Difference].</mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>“Eagle” understood it very clearly, also wasn’t ashamed to admit it:</p>
    <p>The little girl in front of his eyes, was far above him in terms of both external and internal strength. </p>
    <p>Even stronger than any person from the Jianghu Society he knew. </p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>The sheer power gap is like heaven and earth, the end of a match would be laid out from the start</p>
    <p>—If only, it was just a match.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>There were two variables, some [Unknowns].</mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>Those two palm blades didn’t use internal force, is the [Binding Dust] still in effect?</p>
    <p>Two people escaped from the dungeon, is the [Raksha] still here?</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>These two unknowns could affect the outcome of this fight, </p>
    <p>if the worst possibility is considered, “Eagle” would have no chance of winning even if it’s a gamble</p>
    <p>—If only, he really ends up in the worst case scenario.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>…The situation was so horrible, the chances of winning were nearly zero.</p>
    <p>But “Eagle” had absolute confidence in victory.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Because, he has yet to count his [advantages].</p>

  <text>"Eagle" sneered.</text>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Advantage Number One: [Experience]. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Compared to his long time in the Jianghu Society, Li Sushang social experience was near nothing. </p>
    <p>She didn’t find the hints buried in “Eagle”’s words at all, </p>
    <p>only walking into the trap step by step unknowingly. </p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Advantage Number Two: it’s [Character]. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Eagle had tasted defeat before. In order to win, he would do anything. </p>
    <p>Li Sushang is really an honest and stupid idiot, </p>
    <p>things such as justice and fairness still occupy a high place in her heart.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If he utilizes the full use of these two advantages,</p>
    <p>And relies on the third advantage.</p>
    <p>Making another bet on the variables.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>“Eagle” believes he can tip the balance of victory to lean towards him.</p>
