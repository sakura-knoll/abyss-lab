  <text>The girl readied herself as if she was holding a sword in her left hand, then clenched it with the right. This was「Crane Moon」—the first stance of the Edge of Taixuan.[\s]And she’d decided that the first attack would be the sixth move of the Li family's 「13 Stances of the Diving Swift」,「Swift Swallow Double Return」.</text>

    <p>Was to confirm this.</p>

    <p>In terms of internal energy, 「Edge of Taixuan」 at the Wanderer's gate was probably number one in all Shenzhou.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>Each faction in Shenzhou had it's own unique way of thinking. However, even though the formalities had changed, their essence remained unchanged—it all came down to training</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>If one were to compare internal energy with water, ordinary internal energy would be like practicing a vessel to hold water, constantly increasing its capacity.[\s]</p>
    <p>Not to mention the need for repeated hard training, the progress was extremely slow, and there was a risk of exceeding the human body's load.</p>
  </mono>
  <bg img="心湖（2）无尘" duration="2"></bg>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>On the other hand, 「Edge of Taixuan」 was fundamentally different from all others.[\s]</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>「Blade Mantra」 trained the「Route」, not the 「Vessel」.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>It absorbed the true energy from all things in heaven and earth, allowing internal energy to flow freely within one's body like a stream of water.</p>
  </mono>
  <bg img="心湖（3）明镜" duration="2"></bg>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>This new method was created by Phoenix, the founder of the Taixuan school.</p>
    <p>It was deep and mysterious, but there were also very large restrictions.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true" inline="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>For example, if men were to train in Edge of Taixuan, the majority of them would be slumped midway through their training and wouldn't get any better. It was impossible for anyone other than exceptionally talented young boys to learn such feats</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>On the other hand, women who practice Taixu sword energy would often get twice the result with half the effort;</p>
