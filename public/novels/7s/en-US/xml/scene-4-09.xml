  <text>An hour ago, Li Sushang defeated the four guards of the Golden Sand Gang and interrogated them. </text>

  <text>
    <p>Her master had casually said [em color=#FAFAD2]「You know the Golden Sand Gang? Go beat their boss and come back.」[/em]</p>

  </text>
  <motion chara="002" action="img_trans" img="素裳-悲伤目下-普通-近景"></motion>
  <text>The girl sighed and tried to come up with a plan.</text>
  <dialog chara="002">Li Sushang:「Hmmm…」</dialog>
  <text>She was very inexperienced, and the only things she could draw inspiration from were stories she had heard from her father, mother, and the storyteller in the village. </text>
  <text>「True Celestial」 Empyrea Phoenix……[\s] 「Willowfoil」 Lin Zhaoyu……[\s] 「Tireless Courser」 Ma Feima…… </text>
  <text>
    <p>The names that shook the Jianghu Society appeared in her mind one by one, and then she eliminated them one by one. </p>
    <p>These were all well-known experts, but they had never landed themselves in a predicament like her. </p>
  </text>
  <dialog chara="002">Li Sushang:「What to do…」</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>[em italic]Yan Shiluo……[/em][\s]</p>
    <p>As if guided by a mysterious force, the strange Martial Arts legend from 40 years ago appeared in the girl’s mind. </p>
  </text>
  <text>She had only heard the story once, but she remembered it unexpectedly and firmly: </text>
  <text>『All the heroes of the Jianghu Society gathered at the Lotus Conference to discuss a plan to attack the Fire Cult.』</text>
  <text>『Unexpectedly, the Fire Cult's holy leader, Yan Shiluo was lurking in disguise, and on the day of the conference he defeated the heads of three gathering sects Shao, Lian, and Hua, set fire to the Lotus Terrace, and went away laughing.』</text>
  <text>Lurking in disguise…</text>

  <dialog chara="002">Li Sushang: (Got it!)</dialog>
  <text>The girl finally concocted a worthy plan.</text>

  <text>Li Sushang's finger pressed lightly against the back of the man's head, extremely softly, but the person under her took a nervous breath.</text>
  <dialog chara="002">Li Sushang:「Hey, don't move, I won't kill you. I just want to make a deal with you.」</dialog>
  <dialog chara="095">Man: [You crazy girl… you, what do you want to do?」</dialog>
  <dialog chara="002">Li Sushang:「Your leader will be back soon. If you let him know that you were beaten like this by me, he will be furious and punish you severely, right?」</dialog>
  <text>The man didn't speak, and Sushang, taking his silence for agreement, went on happily.</text>
  <cg img="CG_第一折_李素裳2"></cg>
  <dialog chara="002">
    <p>Li Sushang:「I have a suggestion. Follow my plan and make sure he doesn't know anything.</p>

  <bg img="牢房-暗"></bg>
  <text>So, the girl「voluntarily」squatted in the Dark Dungeon.</text>
  <text>『The Dark Dungeon』was originally the cellar of this inn. Since the Golden Sand Gang took over this place, its function hadn’t changed, except the stored items were replaced by living people instead of food. </text>
  <text>The bandits’ looted「goods」were thrown into here, and a Baihui slave merchant would visit once a month, 'clean' the dungeon and leave the equivalent worth in gold and silver. For several years, the operation of this「Stop」had been very smooth.</text>
  <text>
    <p>But to sneak into the dungeon and pretend to be「goods」uninvited,</p>
    <p>Li Sushang was probably the first one to do it.</p>
  </text>
  <transition mode="clock" in="1" stop="0.5" out="1" color="#000000"></transition>
  <bg img="牢房-暗"></bg>
  <motion chara="002" action="show" pos="center" img="素裳-标准-抱手-近景"></motion>
  <text>The dungeon was dark and damp, filled with a foul scent, with occasional low sobbing sounds from unknown cells, and occasional moments of silence. </text>
  <text>
    <p>Sushang spread out a makeshift mat with only a few withered weeds,</p>
    <p>sat down properly, and recited the『Blade Mantra Swara』to pass time.</p>
  </text>
  <motion chara="002" action="hide"></motion>
  <bg img="PureBlack" duration="2"></bg>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>The Blade Mantra Swara was the introductory mental method of『Edge of Taixuan』, </p>
    <p>It was a unique skill highly coveted by everyone in the Jianghu Society.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>But unbeknownst to most, the true body of the Blade Mantra Swara were just strange and inexplicable syllables. </p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true" inline="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>The syllables were formless, they could not be described by words;</p>
    <p>It taught neither Ki circulation, nor did it guide body training;</p>
    <p>The so-called『Blade Mantra Swara』, was absolutely meaningless.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>If you listened to the Blade Mantra Swara, you would treat it as the babble of an idiot in a dream. </p>
    <p>It was impossible to think that this was the magnificent technique that reigned on top of the martial arts in Shenzhou for thousands of years.  </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>As everyone knew, this was where mystery lay:</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">
    <p></p>
    <p>Recitation, meditation, and listening were training of the mind.</p>

  <dialog chara="002">Li Sushang:「…Mu… talali… mu… nokulo…」</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>The words had power. </p>
    <p>Sushang may not understand it, but she did feel the transformation of her『Heart』. </p>
  </text>
  <text>With the reverberation of the words, the ups and downs of the rhythm, the Blade Mantra Swara seemed to seep through her blood, wandering through eight of her meridians. </text>
  <dialog chara="002">Li Sushang:「Mu, mali.」</dialog>
  <bg img="心湖（1）止水" duration="10"></bg>
  <text>
    <p>Her body became lighter and lighter, her mind no longer stirred.</p>
    <p>Her five senses converged into a single place, in a single Heart Lake.</p>
  </text>
  <dialog chara="002">Li Sushang:「Mu, Wuliute.」</dialog>
  <text>The lake was clear and transparent, a few melancholy leaves fell on the lake surface, yet they didn’t make a ripple. </text>
  <dialog chara="002">Li Sushang:「Mu, kabayisiliu.」</dialog>
  <text>The waves were calm, the water silent. The lake calmly reflected the existence of [Li Sushang]. </text>
  <text>
    <p>This was the first out of the four stages of the Blade Mantra</p>
    <p>-『Still Water』. </p>
  </text>
  <dialog chara="002">Li Sushang: (Moving on…)</dialog>
  <text>
    <p>Sushang rid herself of trivial thoughts, transforming the Blade Mantra further.</p>
    <p>Climbing the next level——</p>

  <bg img="心湖（2）无尘" duration="5"></bg>
  <delay t="4.5"></delay>
  <text>
    <p>The Heart Lake condensed into ice,</p>
    <p>Brushing away all irrelevant thoughts, without leaving a single trace. </p>

  <text>Second Stage -『Dustless』. </text>

  <text>
    <p>The cracks of the hard ice disappear without a trace,</p>
    <p>and the Heart Lake became almost completely transparent, its light illuminating all creation. </p>
  </text>
  <text>Third Stage -『Clear Mirror』</text>
  <text>After ten years of training, this was the stage of the [Blade Mantra] that Li Sushang had cultivated. </text>
  <text>
    <p>But above this, there was the Blade Mantra’s highest stage…</p>
    <p>Only her Master had reached the fourth stage in the world… that is…</p>

    <p>The ice surface suddenly shattered, the Heart Lake dispersed, and the Blade Mantra withdrew from her mind. </p>
    <p>Li Sushang sat there blankly, with a splitting headache, and realized her back was drenched with cold sweat. </p>

  <text>Ever since she reached『Clear Mirror』, Sushang couldn’t make further progress with her Blade Mantra. </text>
  <dialog chara="002">Li Sushang: […Why?」</dialog>
  <text>Mother said that Master had been taught since she was two, she was the earliest one to get started, so her Blade Mantra stage was the highest. </text>
  <text>
    <p>But ever since Sushang was born, she had heard Mother chanting the Blade Mantra Swara day and night,</p>
    <p>so shouldn’t ahe progress faster than Master?</p>
  </text>
  <motion chara="002" action="img_trans" img="素裳-悲伤目前-普通-近景"></motion>

    <p>Master realized『Blade Sanction』when she was only thirteen,</p>

  <text>
    <p>What about her? She was also fifteen…</p>
    <p>She hadn't even fully cultivated『Blade Mantra』yet,</p>
    <p>And had no clue on where to start with『Blade Sanction』. </p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>Even after overcoming these two peaks, </p>
    <p>There was still the essence of「Eminence」standing above them, shrouded by clouds, and wasn’t visibly real. </p>

  <dialog chara="002">Li Sushang:「…」</dialog>

  <text>
    <p>『Emotions』were the enemy of the『heart』. </p>
    <p>If emotions were allowed to create waves in the Heart Lake, Blade Mantra may be damaged. </p>
    <p>Sushang knew this since she had a Clear Mirror heart. </p>
