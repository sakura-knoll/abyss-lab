  <text>Huh, huh, huh, huh…</text>
  <text>
    <p>The hooves sounded again, and the wheels rolled forward. </p>
    <p>Men with swords and greatswords flocked around, guarding the men, horses, gold and silver of the caravan.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>Nothing seemed to have changed, even though everything was completely overturned: </p>
    <p>The merchants had been reduced to slaves, and the robbers had become their masters.</p>

  <text>Boots stepped on the warm sand, and a faint warmth came from the soles of the feet.</text>

  <text>The place he stepped on sunk slightly, causing his center of gravity to shake, as if being gently pulled by the earth. For「Eagle」, this feeling always reminded him of the blood-soaked snow in the Raksha Kingdom.</text>
  <text>「Eagle」hated snow.</text>

  <text>「Eagle」who had won a big victory was expressionless, his gloominess was like a barrier, forming a field centered on him: outside this were the joyous sand bandits, and inside was muddy silence.</text>

  <text>He should have been in a very good mood, but today's raid was really too beautiful and too successful.</text>
  <text>The seized silver commodities were worth tens of thousands, and even if they change hands quickly, they could make a net profit of seven or eight thousand taels of silver.</text>
  <text>There were nine middle-aged men and women captives, of which there were quite a few high-class goods, and the Baihui slave traders would pay a lot of money to get their hands on them.</text>

    <p>But the most gratifying thing was the performance of his gang brethren.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>It was totally different from the decadence when he first took over the Golden Sand Gang.</p>

    <p>Although the caravan was in an ambush this time, the bodyguards did their best;</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>after a moment of panic, they quickly regrouped their soldiers and launched a tenacious resistance. </p>

  <text>「Eagle」liked opponents who resisted.</text>
  <text>
    <p>He was precisely the kind of person who found pleasure and the meaning of existence from challenges.</p>
    <p>The more fierce the opponent's resistance, the higher the value of training.</p>
    <p>The meaning of victory was to bring the highest satisfaction in the ever-increasing value——</p>

  <mono>——In the white snow of the Northern Lands, he once believed that this kind of satisfaction had reached its peak.</mono>
  <mono>——He tried his best to escape from the place where his father, brother and his comrades died, and he used politics as a new battlefield, thinking that he would still be able to conquer the situation.</mono>
  <mono>
    <p></p>
    <p>——After being wronged and imprisoned, his new "comrades-in-arms" abandoned him. It was not the pain and regret that made him wake up countless times from his dreams, but the time spent fighting with the Raksha demons.</p>
  </mono>
  <mono pageend="true">——Those who saved his life to rescue him from the dispatched army, were the loyal subordinates he had left behind.</mono>

  <text>Ever since then,「Eagle」finally understood that his life would stay forever in that long war.</text>

    <p>The moment he left the Raksha Kingdom, his life had stagnated. </p>
    <p>The rest of the time, he was just a walking corpse repeating its worthless actions.</p>
  </text>
  <text>
    <p>That’s why he fled to the Northern Desert, captured the Golden Sand Gang, and got a group of loyal soldiers.</p>
    <p>He tempered, spurred, and tortured them;</p>
    <p>sent them to death and lived with them.</p>

    <p>Repeating the past,</p>
    <p>avenging the past,</p>
    <p>yearning for the past.</p>
